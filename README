Project just started. When all specification will be satified, release (tag on github) will be created.

Goals to be implemented:
1. full asynchronous event model both client and server
2. io_service per cpu design
see for tests http://think-async.com/Asio/LinuxPerformanceImprovements
very simple pretty example http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/doc/html/boost_asio/example/http/server2/io_service_pool.cpp

Project is developed with cmake 2.8.5, boost 1.46.1. I prefer netbeans for code highlighting
I am not using TDD to develop. Tests will be created later
Nginx conf to test:
	location /fcgi_test {
                autoindex off;
                include fastcgi_params;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/tmp/fcgi_test.sock;
                fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/fcgi_test)(.*)$;
                fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME /path/to/cpp/libfcgicpp/lifcgicpp;
                fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
        }
Please check that nginx has enough rights to access fcgi_test.sock which is created by libfcgicpp binary.

For debug in netbeans check:
1. "Project Properties -> Code Assistance -> C++ Compiler -> Include Directories" add "include" folder
