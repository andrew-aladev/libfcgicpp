Project just started. When all specification will be satified, release (tag on github) will be created.
Project is developed with cmake 2.8.5, boost 1.46.1. I prefer netbeans for code highlighting
I am not using TDD to develop. Tests will be created later
Nginx conf to test:
	location /fcgi_test {
                autoindex off;
                include fastcgi_params;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/tmp/fcgi_test.sock;
                fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/fcgi_test)(.*)$;
                fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME /path/to/cpp/libfcgipp/lifcgipp;
                fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
        }
Please check that nginx has enough rights to access fcgi_test.sock which is created by libfcgipp binary
For debug in netbeans check that "Project Properties -> Run -> Console Type" equals "Output Window" and gdb is installed
